*Disclaimer: I am NOT responsible for any damage that may arise from the use of this utility, including, but not limited to bricked phones, computers catching fire or nuclear reactions.*

*WARNING: Always use the `--resize` option. As far as I know most devices just stretch the images, but I now consider the default behavior of the replace command to be unsafe, as it does not resize the images by default.*

# alectrona

alectrona is a boot logo manipulator programmed that was created with the intention to be device-agnostic. For now it can extract header information, images and "replace" the images on the file, generating a new valid logo.bin.

## Features

- Extracts header information and images from boot logo files.
- Replaces images in boot logo files.
- Device-agnostic: in other words, this utility **should** be able to work with the logo.bin format of any device.
- Free and open source.

## Known Bugs

- For now, none!

## Installation Steps

For now, to install you need cargo (which comes with rustup). Just follow the installation steps at https://rustup.rs/ and then run ```cargo install --git https://github.com/pheki/alectrona.git```.

Make sure you have rust's bin folder ($HOME/.cargo/bin) on your path.

## Usage
Note: this program will overwrite files by default, so be careful with your filenames.

There are 4 possible subcommands to use with the alectrona-cli package:
- header: prints the file header
- extract: extracts a single logo from the file
- extract-all: extracts all logos from the file to a directory (folder)
- replace: replaces some logos in the file with provided images

Every one of them can be used with the following syntax:
```
alectrona -d <DEVICE_CODENAME> -i <ORIGINAL_LOGO_PATH.BIN> <subcommand> ...
```

### Get header info

Syntax:
```
alectrona -d <DEVICE_CODENAME> -i <ORIGINAL_LOGO_PATH.BIN> header
```
Example:
```
alectrona -d harpia -i logo_original.bin header
```

### Extract single image
Syntax:
```
alectrona -d <DEVICE_CODENAME> -i <ORIGINAL_LOGO_PATH.BIN> extract <LOGO_IDENTIFIER> --output <OUTPUT_FILE>
```

Example:
```
alectrona -d harpia -i logo_original.bin extract logo_boot -o logo_boot.png
```

### Extract all images
Syntax:
```
alectrona -d <DEVICE_CODENAME> -i <ORIGINAL_LOGO_PATH.BIN> extract-all --output <OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>
```

Example:
```
alectrona -d harpia -i logo_original.bin extract-all -o extraction_folder/
```

### Replace logo images
NOTE: This does NOT resize images BY DEFAULT, and flashing a boot logo with images with the wrong size may have unexpected results depending on your device. Please be careful.

Syntax:
```
alectrona -d <DEVICE_CODENAME> -i <ORIGINAL_LOGO_PATH.BIN> [--resize] replace <LOGO_IDENTIFIER INPUT_IMAGE>... --output <OUTPUT_FILE>
```

For each LOGO_IDENTIFIER INPUT_IMAGE pair, the logo with identifier LOGO_IDENTIFIER will be replaced with the image INPUT_IMAGE.
In this case, -r or --resize can be used BEFORE (this will probably change in the future) replace and the images will be resized to the device size.

Example:
```
alectrona -d harpia -i logo_original.bin replace logo_boot new_boot_logo.png logo_battery new_battery_image.png -o new_logo.bin
```

## Tests

As automated tests depend on the original logo.bin found on devices, they won't be published here for legal reasons. But the main tests are basically sanity tests which verify testing if encoding / decoding generates the same files.
